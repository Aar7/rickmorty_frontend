API FLOW FOR NAVIGATING ACROSS PAGES

1   On clicking header tab, first 20 results are loaded. There is the 'previous' and 'next' page arrows
2   Clicking on an arrow will send a request to the API with the prev or next field in the 'info' object of the response. Therefore, these fields need to be saved and updated for an API request. One could just calculate when the user is at the end page, but this seems unecessary as the data is handed to us.
